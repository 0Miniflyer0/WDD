            also known as the ketogenic diet, is a diet that specializes in low carbs, and high fat. The trick with the keto diet. 
            You eat less carbs, and have an increase in fat intake. Which helps put your body in a state of <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-ketosis"
            class = "content-link-ketosis">ketosis</a>. And also not to mention that your body primarily uses fat as it's biggest source of energy.
            Which leads to it being burned more. Personally, I have used this diet for atleast a year, and I lost atleast 50 pounds, when i was doing it.
