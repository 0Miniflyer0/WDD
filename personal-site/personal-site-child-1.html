            <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-101#what-it-is" class="content-link-keto">The Keto Diet</a>
            also known as the ketogenic diet, is a diet that specializes in low carbs, and high fat. The trick with the keto diet. 
            You eat less carbs, and have an increase in fat intake. Which helps put your body in a state of <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-ketosis"
            class = "content-link-ketosis">ketosis</a>. And also not to mention that your body primarily uses fat as it's biggest source of energy.
            Which leads to it being burned more. Personally, I have used this diet for atleast a year, and I lost atleast 50 pounds, when i was doing it.

            essentially is what pushing your limits to the next level, it's all about trying to break that limit. Take cardio for an example.
            With cardio if you are used to jogging. But then if you sprint, you can sprint for like say 2 minutes. With High Intensity Interval Training. 
            The goal is to break those comfort zones. In the example provided. Want to up that sprint limit from 2 minute, to 3 or 4 minutes.

            So why do this, <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-hiit" class = "contentlink-HITT-benefits">why use High Intensity Interval Training?</a>
            You burn calories alot more with HITT, I've done this from experience, when I was like 16, before Covid, I was a in a weightlifting class. And I had lifted heavier and heavier weights.
            To the point where i could bench 250LBS. I started only being able to do 90 LBS, but by the time Before Covid Hit, I was able to do 250. I also noticed quite a bit of weight loss. 
            I lost about 7.5LBS throughout the duration of this, so it helps you burn fat. One of the big benefits to this, is that your Metabolism will
            Be higher afterwards. And for refresher: the chemical processes that occur in the body's cells to convert food into energy, and to create the materials cells need to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy.
