                what is it? This is one of my personal favorites, and i still use it to this day. This is one of the diets where you are not limited to 
                eating a certain family or type of foods while neglecting the other. With this particular diet you can eat whatever you like. Instead, you
                are time-gated. Meaning you can only eat at certain points of the day, and after that time expires, you shouldn't eat anymore till the next time rolls 
                around. You are allowed to drink water though,
            </p>

            <p>For Example, You start eating at 12PM afternoon, till then you can eat up untill 8PM, where you are not allowed to eat anymore till 12pm again. And only Fast, 
            And drink water. It should come as no surprise that this is a good way to lose weight and is safe. But if you have certain conditions.
            It's highly advised to consult a doctor before trying this.

            When you think of <a href = "https://www.physio-pedia.com/Strength_Training" class = "strength-training-link">Strength Training</a> 
            you probably think of just lifting heavy weights, or weightlifting. This is technically true, but the purpose of strength training is
            to help increase muscle strength by helping your muscles work against a weight or force. 
            Some exercises you can do with this involve squats, pushups, weightlifting, resistance bands.
